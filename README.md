I developed a Python application that sends a request to the API at "https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts" and stores the received JSON data in an SQLite database.
API Request: I sent a GET request to the API and received the JSON data.
Database Creation: I created an SQLite database to store the data, and within this database, there is a table for storing cat facts.
Storing Data: I stored the cat facts retrieved from the API into the SQLite database.
Data Visualization: I displayed the cat facts saved in the database in the terminal/powershell. Additionally, I visualized how many users entered how many cat facts and viewed the facts they entered. I also added new cat facts to the database manually and displayed both the newly added data and the existing data.
